GeoKingdoms is a game/web host. It's inspired by geocities, the indie web, and the spirit of adventure. The core vision is to provide a platform that encourages exploring the web and developing unique content in ways that are resistent to indexing and centralization. 

You, the player, explore The Realm as its built by players. You can develop your own kingdom by building web pages with traditional html and js, but you can't link to another website without first visiting it yourself. To visit a website, you have to walk there in game.
